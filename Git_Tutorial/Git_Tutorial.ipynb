    "- ** You can undo anything: ** Git provides a *complete history* of every change that has ever been made to your project, timestamped, commented, and attributed. If something breaks, you always have the choice of going back to a previous state.\n",
    "- ** You won't *need* to keep undo-ing things: ** One of the advantages of using git properly is that by keeping new changes separate from a stable base, you tend to avoid the massive rollbacks associated with constantly tinkering with a single code.\n",
    "- ** You can identify exactly when and where changes were made: ** Git allows you to pinpoint when a particular piece of code was changed, so finding what other pieces of code a bug might affect or figuring out why a certain expression was added is easy.\n",
    "- ** Git forces teams to face conflicts directly: ** On a team-based project, many people are often working with the same code. By having a tool which understands when and where files were changed, it's easy to see when changes might conflict with each other. While it might seem troublesome sometimes to have to deal with conflicts, the alternative&mdash;*not* knowing there's a conflict&mdash;is much more insidious."

    "The first thing to understand about git is that the contents of your project are stored in several different states and forms at any given time. If you think about what version control is, this might not be surprising: in order to remember every change that's ever been made, you need to store a record of those changes *somewhere*, and to be able to handle multiple people changing the same code, you need to have different copies of the project and a way to combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think about git operating on four different areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Git Commands](img/git_layout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The **working directory** is what you're currently looking at. When you use an editor to modify a file, the changes are made to the working directory.\n",
    " - The **staging area** is a place to collect a set of changes made to your project. If you have changed three files to fix a bug, you will add all three to the staging area so that you can remember the changes as one historical entity. It is also called the **index**. You move files from the working directory to the index using the command `git add`.\n",
    " - The **local repository** is the place where git stores everything you've ever done to your project. Even when you delete a file, a copy is stored in the repo (this is necessary for always being able to undo any change). It's important to note that a local repository doesn't look much at all like your project files or directories. Git has its own way of storing all the information, and if you're curious what it looks like, look in the `.git` directory in the working directory of your project. Files are moved from the index to the local repository via the command `git commit`.\n",
    " - When working in a team, every member will be working on their own local repository. An **upstream repository** allows everyone to agree on a single version of history. If two people have made changes on their local repositories, they will combine those changes in the upstream repository. In our case this upstream repository is hosted by Bitbucket. This need not be the case; SEAS provides git hosting, as do companies like Github. This upstream repository is also called a **remote** in git parlance. The standard bitbucket remote is called the **origin**: it is the repository which is given a web page on bitbucket. One usually moves code from local to remote repositories using `git push`, and in the other direction using `git fetch`.\n",

    "** * Commit early, commit often. * **\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is more effective when used at a fine granularity. For starters, you can't undo what you haven't committed, so committing lots of small changes makes it easier to find the right rollback point. Also, merging becomes a lot easier when you only have to deal with a handful of conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "** * Commit unrelated changes separately. * **\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the source of a bug or understanding the reason why a particular piece of code exists is much easier when commits focus on related changes. Some of this has to do with simplifying commit messages and making it easier to look through logs, but it has other related benefits: commits are smaller and simpler, and merge conflicts are confined to only the commits which actually have conflicting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "** * Do not commit binaries and other temporary files. * **\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is meant for tracking changes. In nearly all cases, the only meaningful difference between the contents of two binaries is that they are different. If you change source files, compile, and commit the resulting binary, git sees an entirely different file. The end result is that the git repository (which contains a complete history, remember) begins to become bloated with the history of many dissimilar binaries. Worse, there's often little advantage to keeping those files in the history. An argument can be made for periodically snapshotting working binaries, but things like object files, compiled python files, and editor auto-saves are basically wasted space.\n",
    "\n",
    "** * Ignore files which should not be committed * **\n",
    "\n",
    "Git comes with a built-in mechanism for ignoring certain types of files. Placing filenames or wildcards in a `.gitignore` file placed in the top-level directory (where the `.git` directory is also located) will cause git to ignore those files when checking file status. This is a good way to ensure you don't commit the wrong files accidentally, and it also makes the output of `git status` somewhat cleaner.\n",

    "While it's tempting to work on new code directly in the `master` branch, it's usually a good idea to create a new one instead, especially for team-based projects. The major advantage to this practice is that it keeps logically disparate change sets separate. This means that if two people are working on improvements in two different branches, when they merge, the actual workflow is reflected in the git history. Plus, explicitly creating branches adds some semantic meaning to your branch structure. Moreover, there is very little difference in how you use git.\n",
