**Git_tutorial** covers useful Git basics and how you get your hw/lab using GitHub Classroom. Please have a look, really important!

**FinalProject-Sophie** is a demo of my final project in Fall 2016. It was programmed in Python 2.7 with all the outdated packages so you could experience some error when you attempt to run the whole notebook. No need to worry, not a lot have been changed in Python3.6 and the new version of packages!
